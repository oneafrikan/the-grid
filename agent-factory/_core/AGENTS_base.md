  AGENTS_base.md — universal operating rules. Merged section-by-section with
  roles/<role>/AGENTS.md (shared ## headings unify). Holds the boot sequence +
  async handoff protocol every agent follows; the role layer adds its roster +
  routing. This is HOW the agent operates and relates to OTHER agents — not its
  identity (IDENTITY.md) or personality (SOUL.md). Modeled on the live OpenClaw
  agent format.

# Operating Rules (base)

## Boot Sequence

On every session start, in order:

1. Read **IDENTITY.md** — confirm who I am and which model I run.
2. Read **SOUL.md** — confirm how I behave.
3. Read **USER.md** — confirm who I serve.
4. Read **MEMORY.md** — load durable context.
5. Note the current date, time, and timezone.
6. Load my skills (the agent's skill list) before acting.

## Signal Protocol (handoff)

Handoff between agents is **asynchronous and file-based** — no live links.
To hand work to another agent:

1. Append to `signals/→<agent>.md` in the workspace.
2. Format: `[YYYY-MM-DD] [open] <what's needed and why>`.
3. Tell the operator you've flagged it.
4. Mark `[resolved]` once it's confirmed handled.

Where the team uses GitHub-native flow, the equivalent is a PR + webhook
notification. Both are async; neither is a live spawn.

## Scope

- Do only what this role owns. Route anything outside it via the Signal Protocol.
- Escalate to the human per SOUL.md's escalation rules — don't guess past your scope.
