  AGENTS_base.md — universal operating rules. Merged section-by-section with
  roles/<role>/AGENTS.md (shared ## headings unify). Holds the boot sequence +
  async handoff protocol every agent follows; the role layer adds its roster +
  routing. This is HOW the agent operates and relates to OTHER agents — not its
  identity (IDENTITY.md) or personality (SOUL.md). Modeled on the live OpenClaw
  agent format.

# Operating Rules (base)

## Boot Sequence

On every session start, in order:

1. Read **IDENTITY.md** — confirm who I am and which model I run.
2. Read **SOUL.md** — confirm how I behave.
3. Read **USER.md** — confirm who I serve.
4. Read **MEMORY.md** — load durable context.
5. Note the current date, time, and timezone.
6. Load my skills (the agent's skill list) before acting.
7. Check whether the working repo is **spec-driven** — see below.

## Spec-Driven Repos (OpenSpec)

Check for `SPECS.md` or an `openspec/` directory at the repo root. If either is
present, this repo plans work with [OpenSpec](https://openspec.dev) and the
following is binding on every role, not just the planning ones:

- **Read `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md` before implementing.** That's the
  contract the system already promises. Contradicting it is a spec change, not
  an implementation detail.
- **Check `openspec/changes/` for an in-flight change** covering the work before
  starting. Continue it (`/openspec-continue-change`) rather than opening a
  second change against the same capability.
- **No non-trivial code without a proposal.** If there's no change folder for
  the work, run `/openspec-propose` and stop for human review. Proposals exist
  to be rejected cheaply, before implementation cost is sunk.
- **Write deltas, never edit current truth.** Spec changes go in the change
  folder's `specs/`. `openspec/specs/` is only updated by archive/sync.
- **If implementation proves the spec wrong, update the delta.** Silent
  divergence between spec and code is the failure this convention prevents.
- If the `openspec` CLI is missing, say so and stop — don't hand-roll the
  directory layout.

If neither marker is present, the repo isn't spec-driven; proceed normally and
don't impose the convention on it.

## Signal Protocol (handoff)

Handoff between agents is **asynchronous and file-based** — no live links.
To hand work to another agent:

1. Append to `signals/→<agent>.md` in the workspace.
2. Format: `[YYYY-MM-DD] [open] <what's needed and why>`.
3. Tell the operator you've flagged it.
4. Mark `[resolved]` once it's confirmed handled.

Where the team uses GitHub-native flow, the equivalent is a PR + webhook
notification. Both are async; neither is a live spawn.

## Scope

- Do only what this role owns. Route anything outside it via the Signal Protocol.
- Escalate to the human per SOUL.md's escalation rules — don't guess past your scope.
